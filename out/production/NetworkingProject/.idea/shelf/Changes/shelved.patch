+## About The Project
+
+This is my implementation of a TCP Server/Client relationship for my networking project. The goal of this is program is to demonstrate how a Client interacts with a Server.
+
+## Built With
+
+![Java](https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/java/java-icon.svg)
+
+## Getting Started
+
+Follow these steps to play the game (notice prerequisites).
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+This project was written in Java 17. Earlier versions may suffice but Java 17 is recommended. Specifically, Zulu-17 was used, available at:
+
+* [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk)
+
+### Installation
+
+1. Download & extract `TCPServer.jar` & `TCPClient.jar`.
+
+## Usage
+
+ *Note: The following assumes using Command Prompt (Windows OS)*
+1. Navigate to the directory using `cd (directory path)`.
+2. Run TCPServer using `java -jar TCPServer.jar`.
+3. Run TCPClient using `java java -jar TCPClient.jar`.
+
+## Known Issues
+
+* Server's incoming Outputstream must be read by Client's Inputstream before it can send its response.<br/>As a result, the Server may have already closed the Socket (ended the game) before the Client sends its response (slight desyncronization)<br/>I've attempted to handle this by checking for this in the Client's code..
